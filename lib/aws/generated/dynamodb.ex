  Amazon DynamoDB

  Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and
  predictable performance with seamless scalability.

  DynamoDB lets you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a
  distributed database, so that you don't have to worry about hardware
  provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or
  cluster scaling.

  With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any
  amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. You can scale up or
  scale down your tables' throughput capacity without downtime or performance
  degradation, and use the Amazon Web Services Management Console to monitor
  resource utilization and performance metrics.

  DynamoDB automatically spreads the data and traffic for your tables over a
  sufficient number of servers to handle your throughput and storage requirements,
  while maintaining consistent and fast performance. All of your data is stored on
  solid state disks (SSDs) and automatically replicated across multiple
  Availability Zones in an Amazon Web Services Region, providing built-in high
  availability and data durability.

  This operation allows you to perform batch reads or writes on data stored in
  DynamoDB, using PartiQL.

  Each read statement in a `BatchExecuteStatement` must specify an equality
  condition on all key attributes. This enforces that each `SELECT` statement in a
  batch returns at most a single item.

  The entire batch must consist of either read statements or write statements, you
  cannot mix both in one batch.

  The `BatchGetItem` operation returns the attributes of one or more items from
  one or more tables.

  You identify requested items by primary key.

  A single operation can retrieve up to 16 MB of data, which can contain as many
  as 100 items. `BatchGetItem` returns a partial result if the response size limit
  is exceeded, the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded, more than 1MB per
  partition is requested, or an internal processing failure occurs. If a partial
  result is returned, the operation returns a value for `UnprocessedKeys`. You can
  use this value to retry the operation starting with the next item to get.

  If you request more than 100 items, `BatchGetItem` returns a
  `ValidationException` with the message "Too many items requested for the
  BatchGetItem call."

  For example, if you ask to retrieve 100 items, but each individual item is 300
  KB in size, the system returns 52 items (so as not to exceed the 16 MB limit).
  It also returns an appropriate `UnprocessedKeys` value so you can get the next
  page of results. If desired, your application can include its own logic to
  assemble the pages of results into one dataset.

  If *none* of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned
  throughput on all of the tables in the request, then `BatchGetItem` returns a
  `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`. If *at least one* of the items is
  successfully processed, then `BatchGetItem` completes successfully, while
  returning the keys of the unread items in `UnprocessedKeys`.

  If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation
  on those items. However, *we strongly recommend that you use an exponential
  backoff algorithm*. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying
  read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual
  tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the
  individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed.

  For more information, see [Batch Operations and Error Handling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ErrorHandling.html#BatchOperations)
  in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

  By default, `BatchGetItem` performs eventually consistent reads on every table
  in the request. If you want strongly consistent reads instead, you can set
  `ConsistentRead` to `true` for any or all tables.

  In order to minimize response latency, `BatchGetItem` may retrieve items in
  parallel.

  When designing your application, keep in mind that DynamoDB does not return
  items in any particular order. To help parse the response by item, include the
  primary key values for the items in your request in the `ProjectionExpression`
  parameter.

  If a requested item does not exist, it is not returned in the result. Requests
  for nonexistent items consume the minimum read capacity units according to the
  type of read. For more information, see [Working with Tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithTables.html#CapacityUnitCalculations)
  in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

  The `BatchWriteItem` operation puts or deletes multiple items in one or more
  tables.

  A single call to `BatchWriteItem` can transmit up to 16MB of data over the
  network, consisting of up to 25 item put or delete operations. While individual
  items can be up to 400 KB once stored, it's important to note that an item's
  representation might be greater than 400KB while being sent in DynamoDB's JSON
  format for the API call. For more details on this distinction, see [Naming Rules and Data
  Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.NamingRulesDataTypes.html).

  `BatchWriteItem` cannot update items. If you perform a `BatchWriteItem`
  operation on an existing item, that item's values will be overwritten by the
  operation and it will appear like it was updated. To update items, we recommend
  you use the `UpdateItem` action.

  The individual `PutItem` and `DeleteItem` operations specified in
  `BatchWriteItem` are atomic; however `BatchWriteItem` as a whole is not. If any
  requested operations fail because the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded
  or an internal processing failure occurs, the failed operations are returned in
  the `UnprocessedItems` response parameter. You can investigate and optionally
  resend the requests. Typically, you would call `BatchWriteItem` in a loop. Each
  iteration would check for unprocessed items and submit a new `BatchWriteItem`
  request with those unprocessed items until all items have been processed.

  If *none* of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned
  throughput on all of the tables in the request, then `BatchWriteItem` returns a
  `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`.

  If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation
  on those items. However, *we strongly recommend that you use an exponential
  backoff algorithm*. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying
  read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual
  tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the
  individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed.

  For more information, see [Batch Operations and Error Handling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/ErrorHandling.html#Programming.Errors.BatchOperations)
  in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

  With `BatchWriteItem`, you can efficiently write or delete large amounts of
  data, such as from Amazon EMR, or copy data from another database into DynamoDB.
  In order to improve performance with these large-scale operations,
  `BatchWriteItem` does not behave in the same way as individual `PutItem` and
  `DeleteItem` calls would. For example, you cannot specify conditions on
  individual put and delete requests, and `BatchWriteItem` does not return deleted
  items in the response.

  If you use a programming language that supports concurrency, you can use threads
  to write items in parallel. Your application must include the necessary logic to
  manage the threads. With languages that don't support threading, you must update
  or delete the specified items one at a time. In both situations,
  `BatchWriteItem` performs the specified put and delete operations in parallel,
  giving you the power of the thread pool approach without having to introduce
  complexity into your application.

  Parallel processing reduces latency, but each specified put and delete request
  consumes the same number of write capacity units whether it is processed in
  parallel or not. Delete operations on nonexistent items consume one write
  capacity unit.

  If one or more of the following is true, DynamoDB rejects the entire batch write
  operation:

    * One or more tables specified in the `BatchWriteItem` request does
  not exist.

    * Primary key attributes specified on an item in the request do not
  match those in the corresponding table's primary key schema.

    * You try to perform multiple operations on the same item in the
  same `BatchWriteItem` request. For example, you cannot put and delete the same
  item in the same `BatchWriteItem` request.

    * Your request contains at least two items with identical hash and
  range keys (which essentially is two put operations).

    * There are more than 25 requests in the batch.

    * Any individual item in a batch exceeds 400 KB.

    * The total request size exceeds 16 MB.

  Creates a backup for an existing table.

  Each time you create an on-demand backup, the entire table data is backed up.
  There is no limit to the number of on-demand backups that can be taken.

  When you create an on-demand backup, a time marker of the request is cataloged,
  and the backup is created asynchronously, by applying all changes until the time
  of the request to the last full table snapshot. Backup requests are processed
  instantaneously and become available for restore within minutes.

  You can call `CreateBackup` at a maximum rate of 50 times per second.

  All backups in DynamoDB work without consuming any provisioned throughput on the
  table.

  If you submit a backup request on 2018-12-14 at 14:25:00, the backup is
  guaranteed to contain all data committed to the table up to 14:24:00, and data
  committed after 14:26:00 will not be. The backup might contain data
  modifications made between 14:24:00 and 14:26:00. On-demand backup does not
  support causal consistency.

  If you want to add a new replica table to a global table, each of the following
  conditions must be true:

    * The table must have the same primary key as all of the other
  replicas.

    * The table must have the same name as all of the other replicas.

    * The table must have DynamoDB Streams enabled, with the stream
  containing both the new and the old images of the item.

    * None of the replica tables in the global table can contain any
  data.

  If global secondary indexes are specified, then the following conditions must
  also be met:

    * The global secondary indexes must have the same name.

    * The global secondary indexes must have the same hash key and sort
  key (if present).

  If local secondary indexes are specified, then the following conditions must
  also be met:

    * The local secondary indexes must have the same name.

    * The local secondary indexes must have the same hash key and sort
  key (if present).

  Write capacity settings should be set consistently across your replica tables
  and secondary indexes. DynamoDB strongly recommends enabling auto scaling to
  manage the write capacity settings for all of your global tables replicas and
  indexes.

  If you prefer to manage write capacity settings manually, you should provision
  equal replicated write capacity units to your replica tables. You should also
  provision equal replicated write capacity units to matching secondary indexes

  Returns the current provisioned-capacity quotas for your Amazon Web Services

  When you establish an Amazon Web Services account, the account has initial
  quotas on the maximum read capacity units and write capacity units that you can
  provision across all of your DynamoDB tables in a given Region. Also, there are
  per-table quotas that apply when you create a table there. For more information,
  see [Service, Account, and Table Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Limits.html)
  page in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

  Although you can increase these quotas by filing a case at [Amazon Web Services Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/), obtaining the
  increase is not instantaneous. The `DescribeLimits` action lets you write code
  to compare the capacity you are currently using to those quotas imposed by your
  account so that you have enough time to apply for an increase before you hit a
  quota.

  For example, you could use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to do the
  following:

    1. Call `DescribeLimits` for a particular Region to obtain your
  current account quotas on provisioned capacity there.

    2. Create a variable to hold the aggregate read capacity units
  provisioned for all your tables in that Region, and one to hold the aggregate
  write capacity units. Zero them both.

    3. Call `ListTables` to obtain a list of all your DynamoDB tables.

    4. For each table name listed by `ListTables`, do the following:

      * Call `DescribeTable` with the table name.

      * Use the data returned by `DescribeTable` to add the
  read capacity units and write capacity units provisioned for the table itself to
  your variables.

      * If the table has one or more global secondary indexes
  (GSIs), loop over these GSIs and add their provisioned capacity values to your
  variables as well.

    5. Report the account quotas for that Region returned by
  `DescribeLimits`, along with the total current provisioned capacity levels you
  have calculated.

  This will let you see whether you are getting close to your account-level
  quotas.

  The per-table quotas apply only when you are creating a new table. They restrict
  the sum of the provisioned capacity of the new table itself and all its global
  secondary indexes.

  For existing tables and their GSIs, DynamoDB doesn't let you increase
  provisioned capacity extremely rapidly, but the only quota that applies is that
  the aggregate provisioned capacity over all your tables and GSIs cannot exceed
  either of the per-account quotas.

  You must provide the name of the partition key attribute and a single value for
  that attribute.

  `Query` returns all items with that partition key value. Optionally, you can
  provide a sort key attribute and use a comparison operator to refine the search
  results.

  Use the `KeyConditionExpression` parameter to provide a specific value for the
  partition key. The `Query` operation will return all of the items from the table
  or index with that partition key value. You can optionally narrow the scope of
  the `Query` operation by specifying a sort key value and a comparison operator
  in `KeyConditionExpression`. To further refine the `Query` results, you can
  optionally provide a `FilterExpression`. A `FilterExpression` determines which
  items within the results should be returned to you. All of the other results are
  discarded.

  A `Query` operation always returns a result set. If no matching items are found,
  the result set will be empty. Queries that do not return results consume the
  minimum number of read capacity units for that type of read operation.

  DynamoDB calculates the number of read capacity units consumed based on item
  size, not on the amount of data that is returned to an application. The number
  of capacity units consumed will be the same whether you request all of the
  attributes (the default behavior) or just some of them (using a projection
  expression). The number will also be the same whether or not you use a
  `FilterExpression`.

  `Query` results are always sorted by the sort key value. If the data type of the
  sort key is Number, the results are returned in numeric order; otherwise, the
  results are returned in order of UTF-8 bytes. By default, the sort order is
  ascending. To reverse the order, set the `ScanIndexForward` parameter to false.

  A single `Query` operation will read up to the maximum number of items set (if
  using the `Limit` parameter) or a maximum of 1 MB of data and then apply any
  filtering to the results using `FilterExpression`. If `LastEvaluatedKey` is

  `FilterExpression` is applied after a `Query` finishes, but before the results
  are returned. A `FilterExpression` cannot contain partition key or sort key
  attributes. You need to specify those attributes in the
  `KeyConditionExpression`.

  A `Query` operation can return an empty result set and a `LastEvaluatedKey` if
  all the items read for the page of results are filtered out.

  You can query a table, a local secondary index, or a global secondary index. For
  a query on a table or on a local secondary index, you can set the

  The `Scan` operation returns one or more items and item attributes by accessing

  To have DynamoDB return fewer items, you can provide a `FilterExpression`
  operation.

  If the total size of scanned items exceeds the maximum dataset size limit of 1
  MB, the scan completes and results are returned to the user. The
  `LastEvaluatedKey` value is also returned and the requestor can use the
  `LastEvaluatedKey` to continue the scan in a subsequent operation. Each scan
  response also includes number of items that were scanned (ScannedCount) as part
  of the request. If using a `FilterExpression`, a scan result can result in no
  items meeting the criteria and the `Count` will result in zero. If you did not
  use a `FilterExpression` in the scan request, then `Count` is the same as
  `ScannedCount`.

  `Count` and `ScannedCount` only return the count of items specific to a single
  scan request and, unless the table is less than 1MB, do not represent the total
  number of items in the table.

  A single `Scan` operation first reads up to the maximum number of items set (if
  using the `Limit` parameter) or a maximum of 1 MB of data and then applies any
  filtering to the results if a `FilterExpression` is provided. If
  `LastEvaluatedKey` is present in the response, pagination is required to
  complete the full table scan. For more information, see [Paginating the Results](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Scan.html#Scan.Pagination)
  in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

  `Scan` operations proceed sequentially; however, for faster performance on a
  large table or secondary index, applications can request a parallel `Scan`
  operation by providing the `Segment` and `TotalSegments` parameters. For more
  information, see [Parallel Scan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Scan.html#Scan.ParallelScan)
  in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.

  By default, a `Scan` uses eventually consistent reads when accessing the items
  in a table. Therefore, the results from an eventually consistent `Scan` may not
  include the latest item changes at the time the scan iterates through each item
  in the table. If you require a strongly consistent read of each item as the scan
  iterates through the items in the table, you can set the `ConsistentRead`
  parameter to true. Strong consistency only relates to the consistency of the
  read at the item level.

  DynamoDB does not provide snapshot isolation for a scan operation when the
  `ConsistentRead` parameter is set to true. Thus, a DynamoDB scan operation does
  not guarantee that all reads in a scan see a consistent snapshot of the table
  when the scan operation was requested.

  @doc """
  The `UpdateTimeToLive` method enables or disables Time to Live (TTL) for the
  specified table.

  A successful `UpdateTimeToLive` call returns the current
  `TimeToLiveSpecification`. It can take up to one hour for the change to fully
  process. Any additional `UpdateTimeToLive` calls for the same table during this
  one hour duration result in a `ValidationException`.

  TTL compares the current time in epoch time format to the time stored in the TTL
  attribute of an item. If the epoch time value stored in the attribute is less
  than the current time, the item is marked as expired and subsequently deleted.

  The epoch time format is the number of seconds elapsed since 12:00:00 AM January
  1, 1970 UTC.

  DynamoDB deletes expired items on a best-effort basis to ensure availability of
  throughput for other data operations.

  DynamoDB typically deletes expired items within two days of expiration. The
  exact duration within which an item gets deleted after expiration is specific to
  the nature of the workload. Items that have expired and not been deleted will
  still show up in reads, queries, and scans.

  As items are deleted, they are removed from any local secondary index and global
  secondary index immediately in the same eventually consistent way as a standard
  delete operation.

  For more information, see [Time To Live](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/TTL.html)
  in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
