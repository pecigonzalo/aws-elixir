  CloudTrail

  This is the CloudTrail API Reference.

  It provides descriptions of actions, data types, common parameters, and common
  errors for CloudTrail.

  CloudTrail is a web service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your
  Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The
  recorded information includes the identity of the user, the start time of the
  Amazon Web Services API call, the source IP address, the request parameters, and
  the response elements returned by the service.

  As an alternative to the API, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs,
  which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and
  platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide programmatic
  access to CloudTrail. For example, the SDKs handle cryptographically signing
  requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more
  information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and
  install them, see [Tools to Build on Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/).

  See the [CloudTrail User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html)
  for information about the data that is included with each Amazon Web Services
  API call listed in the log files.

  Configures an event selector or advanced event selectors for your trail.

  Use event selectors or advanced event selectors to specify management and data
  event settings for your trail. If you want your trail to log Insights events, be
  sure the event selector enables logging of the Insights event types you want
  configured for your trail. For more information about logging Insights events,
  see [Logging Insights events for trails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-insights-events-with-cloudtrail.html)
  in the *CloudTrail User Guide*. By default, trails created without specific
  event selectors are configured to log all read and write management events, and
  no data events.

  When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selectors
  or advanced event selectors in all trails. For each trail, if the event matches
  any event selector, the trail processes and logs the event. If the event doesn't
  match any event selector, the trail doesn't log the event.

  Example

    1. You create an event selector for a trail and specify that you
  want write-only events.

    2. The EC2 `GetConsoleOutput` and `RunInstances` API operations
  occur in your account.

    3. CloudTrail evaluates whether the events match your event
  selectors.

    4. The `RunInstances` is a write-only event and it matches your
  event selector. The trail logs the event.

    5. The `GetConsoleOutput` is a read-only event that doesn't match
  your event selector. The trail doesn't log the event.

  The `PutEventSelectors` operation must be called from the Region in which the
  trail was created; otherwise, an `InvalidHomeRegionException` exception is
  thrown.

  You can configure up to five event selectors for each trail. For more
  information, see [Logging management events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-events-with-cloudtrail.html),
  [Logging data events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html),
  and [Quotas in CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/WhatIsCloudTrail-Limits.html)
  in the *CloudTrail User Guide*.

  You can add advanced event selectors, and conditions for your advanced event
  selectors, up to a maximum of 500 values for all conditions and selectors on a
  trail. You can use either `AdvancedEventSelectors` or `EventSelectors`, but not
  both. If you apply `AdvancedEventSelectors` to a trail, any existing
  `EventSelectors` are overwritten. For more information about advanced event
  selectors, see [Logging data events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html)

  You also use `PutInsightSelectors` to turn off Insights event logging, by

  `ApiErrorRateInsight` and `ApiCallRateInsight`.

  To enable Insights on an event data store, you must specify the ARNs (or ID
  suffix of the ARNs) for the source event data store (`EventDataStore`) and the
  destination event data store (`InsightsDestination`). The source event data
  store logs management events and enables Insights. The destination event data
  store logs Insights events based upon the management event activity of the
  source event data store. The source and destination event data stores must
  belong to the same Amazon Web Services account.

  To log Insights events for a trail, you must specify the name (`TrailName`) of
  the CloudTrail trail for which you want to change or add Insights selectors.

  To log CloudTrail Insights events on API call volume, the trail or event data
