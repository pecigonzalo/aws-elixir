  Creates a `Domain`.

  A domain consists of an associated Amazon Elastic File System volume, a list of
  authorized users, and a variety of security, application, policy, and Amazon
  Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) configurations. Users within a domain can share
  notebook files and other artifacts with each other.

  ## EFS storage

  When a domain is created, an EFS volume is created for use by all of the users
  within the domain. Each user receives a private home directory within the EFS
  volume for notebooks, Git repositories, and data files.

  SageMaker uses the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web
  Services KMS) to encrypt the EFS volume attached to the domain with an Amazon
  Web Services managed key by default. For more control, you can specify a
  customer managed key. For more information, see [Protect Data at Rest Using Encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/encryption-at-rest.html).

  ## VPC configuration

  All traffic between the domain and the Amazon EFS volume is through the
  specified VPC and subnets. For other traffic, you can specify the
  `AppNetworkAccessType` parameter. `AppNetworkAccessType` corresponds to the
  network access type that you choose when you onboard to the domain. The
  following options are available:

    * `PublicInternetOnly` - Non-EFS traffic goes through a VPC managed
  by Amazon SageMaker, which allows internet access. This is the default value.

    * `VpcOnly` - All traffic is through the specified VPC and subnets.
  Internet access is disabled by default. To allow internet access, you must
  specify a NAT gateway.

  When internet access is disabled, you won't be able to run a Amazon SageMaker
  Studio notebook or to train or host models unless your VPC has an interface
  endpoint to the SageMaker API and runtime or a NAT gateway and your security
  groups allow outbound connections.

  NFS traffic over TCP on port 2049 needs to be allowed in both inbound and
  outbound rules in order to launch a Amazon SageMaker Studio app successfully.

  Creates an endpoint using the endpoint configuration specified in the request.

  SageMaker uses the endpoint to provision resources and deploy models. You create
  the endpoint configuration with the
  [CreateEndpointConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateEndpointConfig.html) API.

  Use this API to deploy models using SageMaker hosting services.

  You must not delete an `EndpointConfig` that is in use by an endpoint that is
  live or while the `UpdateEndpoint` or `CreateEndpoint` operations are being
  performed on the endpoint. To update an endpoint, you must create a new
  `EndpointConfig`.

  The endpoint name must be unique within an Amazon Web Services Region in your
  Amazon Web Services account.

  When it receives the request, SageMaker creates the endpoint, launches the
  resources (ML compute instances), and deploys the model(s) on them.

  When you call
  [CreateEndpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateEndpoint.html),
  a load call is made to DynamoDB to verify that your endpoint configuration
  exists. When you read data from a DynamoDB table supporting [ `Eventually Consistent Reads`
  ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadConsistency.html),
  the response might not reflect the results of a recently completed write
  operation. The response might include some stale data. If the dependent entities
  are not yet in DynamoDB, this causes a validation error. If you repeat your read
  request after a short time, the response should return the latest data. So retry
  logic is recommended to handle these possible issues. We also recommend that
  customers call
  [DescribeEndpointConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEndpointConfig.html) before calling
  [CreateEndpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateEndpoint.html)
  to minimize the potential impact of a DynamoDB eventually consistent read.

  When SageMaker receives the request, it sets the endpoint status to `Creating`.
  After it creates the endpoint, it sets the status to `InService`. SageMaker can
  then process incoming requests for inferences. To check the status of an
  endpoint, use the
  [DescribeEndpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeEndpoint.html) API.

  If any of the models hosted at this endpoint get model data from an Amazon S3
  location, SageMaker uses Amazon Web Services Security Token Service to download
  model artifacts from the S3 path you provided. Amazon Web Services STS is
  activated in your Amazon Web Services account by default. If you previously
  deactivated Amazon Web Services STS for a region, you need to reactivate Amazon
  Web Services STS for that region. For more information, see [Activating and
  Deactivating Amazon Web Services STS in an Amazon Web Services
  Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_enable-regions.html)
  in the *Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management User Guide*.

  To add the IAM role policies for using this API operation, go to the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/), and choose Roles in the left

  Creates an endpoint configuration that SageMaker hosting services uses to deploy
  models.

  In the configuration, you identify one or more models, created using the
  `CreateModel` API, to deploy and the resources that you want SageMaker to
  provision. Then you call the
  [CreateEndpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateEndpoint.html) API.

  Use this API if you want to use SageMaker hosting services to deploy models into
  production.

  In the request, you define a `ProductionVariant`, for each model that you want
  to deploy. Each `ProductionVariant` parameter also describes the resources that
  you want SageMaker to provision. This includes the number and type of ML compute
  instances to deploy.

  If you are hosting multiple models, you also assign a `VariantWeight` to specify
  how much traffic you want to allocate to each model. For example, suppose that
  you want to host two models, A and B, and you assign traffic weight 2 for model
  A and 1 for model B. SageMaker distributes two-thirds of the traffic to Model A,

  Creates a SageMaker *experiment*.

  An experiment is a collection of *trials* that are observed, compared and

  In the Studio UI, trials are referred to as *run groups* and trial components
  are referred to as *runs*.

  The goal of an experiment is to determine the components that produce the best
  model. Multiple trials are performed, each one isolating and measuring the
  impact of a change to one or more inputs, while keeping the remaining inputs
  constant.

  When you use SageMaker Studio or the SageMaker Python SDK, all experiments,
  trials, and trial components are automatically tracked, logged, and indexed.

  You can select your workforce from one of three providers:

    * A private workforce that you create. It can include employees,
  contractors, and outside experts. Use a private workforce when want the data to
  stay within your organization or when a specific set of skills is required.

    * One or more vendors that you select from the Amazon Web Services
  Marketplace. Vendors provide expertise in specific areas.

    * The Amazon Mechanical Turk workforce. This is the largest
  workforce, but it should only be used for public data or data that has been
  stripped of any personally identifiable information.

  You can also use *automated data labeling* to reduce the number of data objects
  that need to be labeled by a human. Automated data labeling uses *active
  learning* to determine if a data object can be labeled by machine or if it needs
  to be sent to a human worker. For more information, see [Using Automated Data Labeling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms-automated-labeling.html).

  The data objects to be labeled are contained in an Amazon S3 bucket. You create
  a *manifest file* that describes the location of each object. For more

  Use this API to create a model if you want to use SageMaker hosting services or

  Creates an SageMaker notebook instance.

  A notebook instance is a machine learning (ML) compute instance running on a
  Jupyter notebook.

  In a `CreateNotebookInstance` request, specify the type of ML compute instance
  that you want to run. SageMaker launches the instance, installs common libraries
  that you can use to explore datasets for model training, and attaches an ML
  storage volume to the notebook instance.

  SageMaker also provides a set of example notebooks. Each notebook demonstrates
  how to use SageMaker with a specific algorithm or with a machine learning
  framework.

  After receiving the request, SageMaker does the following:

    1. Creates a network interface in the SageMaker VPC.

    2. (Option) If you specified `SubnetId`, SageMaker creates a network
  interface in your own VPC, which is inferred from the subnet ID that you provide
  in the input. When creating this network interface, SageMaker attaches the
  security group that you specified in the request to the network interface that
  it creates in your VPC.

    3. Launches an EC2 instance of the type specified in the request in
  the SageMaker VPC. If you specified `SubnetId` of your VPC, SageMaker specifies
  both network interfaces when launching this instance. This enables inbound
  traffic from your own VPC to the notebook instance, assuming that the security
  groups allow it.

  After creating the notebook instance, SageMaker returns its Amazon Resource Name
  (ARN). You can't change the name of a notebook instance after you create it.

  After SageMaker creates the notebook instance, you can connect to the Jupyter
  server and work in Jupyter notebooks. For example, you can write code to explore
  a dataset that you can use for model training, train a model, host models by
  creating SageMaker endpoints, and validate hosted models.

  Use this operation to update your workforce.

  You can use this operation to require that workers use specific IP addresses to
  work on tasks and to update your OpenID Connect (OIDC) Identity Provider (IdP)
  workforce configuration.

  The worker portal is now supported in VPC and public internet.

  Use `SourceIpConfig` to restrict worker access to tasks to a specific range of
  IP addresses. You specify allowed IP addresses by creating a list of up to ten
  [CIDRs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html). By default, a workforce isn't restricted to specific IP addresses. If you specify a
  range of IP addresses, workers who attempt to access tasks using any IP address
  outside the specified range are denied and get a `Not Found` error message on
  the worker portal.

  To restrict access to all the workers in public internet, add the
  `SourceIpConfig` CIDR value as "10.0.0.0/16".

  Amazon SageMaker does not support Source Ip restriction for worker portals in
  VPC.

  Use `OidcConfig` to update the configuration of a workforce created using your
  own OIDC IdP.

  You can only update your OIDC IdP configuration when there are no work teams
  associated with your workforce. You can delete work teams using the
  [DeleteWorkteam](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteWorkteam.html)
  operation.

  After restricting access to a range of IP addresses or updating your OIDC IdP
  configuration with this operation, you can view details about your update
  workforce using the
  [DescribeWorkforce](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeWorkforce.html)
  operation.

  This operation only applies to private workforces.
