  Sends a prompt for the agent to process and respond to.

  The CLI doesn't support `InvokeAgent`.

    * To continue the same conversation with an agent, use the same
  `sessionId` value in the request.

    * To activate trace enablement, turn `enableTrace` to `true`. Trace
  enablement helps you follow the agent's reasoning process that led it to the
  information it processed, the actions it took, and the final result it yielded.
  For more information, see [Trace enablement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-test.html#trace-events).

    * End a conversation by setting `endSession` to `true`.

    * Include attributes for the session or prompt in the `sessionState`
  object.

  The response is returned in the `bytes` field of the `chunk` object.

    * The `attribution` object contains citations for parts of the
  response.

    * If you set `enableTrace` to `true` in the request, you can trace
  the agent's steps and reasoning process that led it to the response.

    * Errors are also surfaced in the response.
