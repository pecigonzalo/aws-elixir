  With the Amazon Cognito user pools API, you can configure user pools and
  authenticate users.

  To authenticate users from third-party identity providers (IdPs) in this API,
  you can [link IdP users to native user profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-identity-federation-consolidate-users.html).
  Learn more about the authentication and authorization of federated users at
  [Adding user pool sign-in through a third party](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-identity-federation.html)
  and in the [User pool federation endpoints and hosted UI reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-userpools-server-contract-reference.html).

  This API reference provides detailed information about API operations and object
  types in Amazon Cognito.

  Along with resource management operations, the Amazon Cognito user pools API
  includes classes of operations and authorization models for client-side and
  server-side authentication of users. You can interact with operations in the
  Amazon Cognito user pools API as any of the following subjects.

    1. An administrator who wants to configure user pools, app clients,
  users, groups, or other user pool functions.

    2. A server-side app, like a web application, that wants to use its
  Amazon Web Services privileges to manage, authenticate, or authorize a user.

    3. A client-side app, like a mobile app, that wants to make
  unauthenticated requests to manage, authenticate, or authorize a user.

  For more information, see [Using the Amazon Cognito user pools API and user pool endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pools-API-operations.html)
  in the *Amazon Cognito Developer Guide*.

  With your Amazon Web Services SDK, you can build the logic to support
  operational flows in every use case for this API. You can also make direct REST
  API requests to [Amazon Cognito user pools service endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/cognito_identity.html#cognito_identity_your_user_pools_region).

  Prevents the user from signing in with the specified external (SAML or social)
  identity provider (IdP).

  If the user that you want to deactivate is a Amazon Cognito user pools native
  username + password user, they can't use their password to sign in. If the user
  to deactivate is a linked external IdP user, any link between that user and an
  existing user is removed. When the external user signs in again, and the user is
  no longer attached to the previously linked `DestinationUser`, the user must
  create a new user account. See
  [AdminLinkProviderForUser](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_AdminLinkProviderForUser.html).  The `ProviderName` must match the value specified when creating an IdP for the
  pool.

  To deactivate a native username + password user, the `ProviderName` value must
  be `Cognito` and the `ProviderAttributeName` must be `Cognito_Subject`. The
  `ProviderAttributeValue` must be the name that is used in the user pool for the
  user.

  The `ProviderAttributeName` must always be `Cognito_Subject` for social IdPs.
  The `ProviderAttributeValue` must always be the exact subject that was used when
  the user was originally linked as a source user.

  For de-linking a SAML identity, there are two scenarios. If the linked identity
  has not yet been used to sign in, the `ProviderAttributeName` and
  `ProviderAttributeValue` must be the same values that were used for the
  `SourceUser` when the identities were originally linked using `
  AdminLinkProviderForUser` call. (If the linking was done with
  `ProviderAttributeName` set to `Cognito_Subject`, the same applies here).
  However, if the user has already signed in, the `ProviderAttributeName` must be
  `Cognito_Subject` and `ProviderAttributeValue` must be the subject of the SAML
  assertion.
