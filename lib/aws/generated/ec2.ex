  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud

  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides secure and resizable
  computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services Cloud.

  Using Amazon EC2 eliminates the need to invest in hardware up front, so you can
  develop and deploy applications faster. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon
  VPC) enables you to provision a logically isolated section of the Amazon Web
  Services Cloud where you can launch Amazon Web Services resources in a virtual
  network that you've defined. Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides
  block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes are highly
  available and reliable storage volumes that can be attached to any running
  instance and used like a hard drive.

  To learn more, see the following resources:

    * `domain-name-servers` - The IP addresses of up to four domain name
  servers, or AmazonProvidedDNS. The default DHCP option set specifies
  AmazonProvidedDNS. If specifying more than one domain name server, specify the
  IP addresses in a single parameter, separated by commas. To have your instance
  receive a custom DNS hostname as specified in `domain-name`, you must set
  `domain-name-servers` to a custom DNS server.

    * `domain-name` - If you're using AmazonProvidedDNS in `us-east-1`,
  specify `ec2.internal`. If you're using AmazonProvidedDNS in another Region,
  specify `region.compute.internal` (for example,
  `ap-northeast-1.compute.internal`). Otherwise, specify a domain name (for
  example, `ExampleCompany.com`). This value is used to complete unqualified DNS
  hostnames. **Important**: Some Linux operating systems accept multiple domain
  names separated by spaces. However, Windows and other Linux operating systems
  treat the value as a single domain, which results in unexpected behavior. If
  your DHCP options set is associated with a VPC that has instances with multiple
  operating systems, specify only one domain name.

    * `ntp-servers` - The IP addresses of up to four Network Time
  Protocol (NTP) servers.

    * `netbios-name-servers` - The IP addresses of up to four NetBIOS
  name servers.

    * `netbios-node-type` - The NetBIOS node type (1, 2, 4, or 8). We

    * *explicit*: The owner of the snapshot granted create volume

  The list of snapshots returned can be filtered by specifying snapshot IDs,
  snapshot owners, or Amazon Web Services accounts with create volume permissions.
  If no options are specified, Amazon EC2 returns all snapshots for which you have
  create volume permissions.

  If you specify one or more snapshot IDs, only snapshots that have the specified
  IDs are returned. If you specify an invalid snapshot ID, an error is returned.
  If you specify a snapshot ID for which you do not have access, it is not
  included in the returned results.

  If you specify one or more snapshot owners using the `OwnerIds` option, only
  snapshots from the specified owners and for which you have access are returned.
  The results can include the Amazon Web Services account IDs of the specified
  owners, `amazon` for snapshots owned by Amazon, or `self` for snapshots that you
  own.

  If you specify a list of restorable users, only snapshots with create snapshot
  permissions for those users are returned. You can specify Amazon Web Services

  Describes the status of the specified volumes.

  Volume status provides the result of the checks performed on your volumes to
  determine events that can impair the performance of your volumes. The
  performance of a volume can be affected if an issue occurs on the volume's
  underlying host. If the volume's underlying host experiences a power outage or
  system issue, after the system is restored, there could be data inconsistencies
  on the volume. Volume events notify you if this occurs. Volume actions notify
  you if any action needs to be taken in response to the event.

  The `DescribeVolumeStatus` operation provides the following information about
  the specified volumes:

  *Status*: Reflects the current status of the volume. The possible values are
  `ok`, `impaired` , `warning`, or `insufficient-data`. If all checks pass, the
  overall status of the volume is `ok`. If the check fails, the overall status is
  `impaired`. If the status is `insufficient-data`, then the checks might still be
  taking place on your volume at the time. We recommend that you retry the
  request. For more information about volume status, see [Monitor the status of your
  volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-volume-status.html)
  in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.

  *Events*: Reflect the cause of a volume status and might require you to take
  action. For example, if your volume returns an `impaired` status, then the
  volume event might be `potential-data-inconsistency`. This means that your
  volume has been affected by an issue with the underlying host, has all I/O
  operations disabled, and might have inconsistent data.

  *Actions*: Reflect the actions you might have to take in response to an event.
  For example, if the status of the volume is `impaired` and the volume event
  shows `potential-data-inconsistency`, then the action shows `enable-volume-io`.
  This means that you may want to enable the I/O operations for the volume by
  calling the `EnableVolumeIO` action and then check the volume for data
  consistency.

  Volume status is based on the volume status checks, and does not reflect the
  volume state. Therefore, volume status does not indicate volumes in the `error`
  state (for example, when a volume is incapable of accepting I/O.)

  You can modify several parameters of an existing EBS volume, including volume
  size, volume type, and IOPS capacity.

  If your EBS volume is attached to a current-generation EC2 instance type, you
  might be able to apply these changes without stopping the instance or detaching
  the volume from it. For more information about modifying EBS volumes, see
  [Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-modify-volume.html)
  (Linux instances) or [Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ebs-modify-volume.html)
  (Windows instances).

  When you complete a resize operation on your volume, you need to extend the
  volume's file-system size to take advantage of the new storage capacity. For
  more information, see [Extend a Linux file system](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html#recognize-expanded-volume-linux)
  or [Extend a Windows file system](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html#recognize-expanded-volume-windows).

  You can use CloudWatch Events to check the status of a modification to an EBS
  volume. For information about CloudWatch Events, see the [Amazon CloudWatch Events User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/).
  You can also track the status of a modification using
  `DescribeVolumesModifications`. For information about tracking status changes
  using either method, see [Monitor the progress of volume modifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitoring-volume-modifications.html).

  With previous-generation instance types, resizing an EBS volume might require
  detaching and reattaching the volume or stopping and restarting the instance.

  After modifying a volume, you must wait at least six hours and ensure that the
  volume is in the `in-use` or `available` state before you can modify the same

    * An existing virtual private gateway to a transit gateway

    * An existing transit gateway to a new transit gateway

    * An existing transit gateway to a virtual private gateway

  in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide*.

  For Amazon EBS-backed instances, `CreateImage` creates and registers the AMI in

  that you always use `CreateImage` unless you have a specific reason to use
  RegisterImage.

  If needed, you can deregister an AMI at any time. Any modifications you make to
  an AMI backed by an instance store volume invalidates its registration. If you
  make changes to an image, deregister the previous image and register the new
  image.

  ## Register a snapshot of a root device volume

  You can use `RegisterImage` to create an Amazon EBS-backed Linux AMI from a
  snapshot of a root device volume. You specify the snapshot using a block device
  mapping. You can't set the encryption state of the volume using the block device
  mapping. If the snapshot is encrypted, or encryption by default is enabled, the
  root volume of an instance launched from the AMI is encrypted.

  For more information, see [Create a Linux AMI from a snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-ebs.html#creating-launching-ami-from-snapshot)

  ## Amazon Web Services Marketplace product codes

  If any snapshots have Amazon Web Services Marketplace product codes, they are
  copied to the new AMI.

  Windows and some Linux distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
  and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), use the Amazon EC2 billing product code
  associated with an AMI to verify the subscription status for package updates. To
  create a new AMI for operating systems that require a billing product code,
  instead of registering the AMI, do the following to preserve the billing product
  code association:

    1. Launch an instance from an existing AMI with that billing product
  code.

    2. Customize the instance.

    3. Create an AMI from the instance using `CreateImage`.

  Stops an Amazon EBS-backed instance.

  For more information, see [Stop and start your instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Stop_Start.html)
  in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

  You can use the Stop action to hibernate an instance if the instance is [enabled for
  hibernation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enabling-hibernation.html)
  and it meets the [hibernation prerequisites](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/hibernating-prerequisites.html).
  For more information, see [Hibernate your instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Hibernate.html) in
  the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

  We don't charge usage for a stopped instance, or data transfer fees; however,
  your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains and continues to persist your
  data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. Every time you start your
  instance, Amazon EC2 charges a one-minute minimum for instance usage, and
  thereafter charges per second for instance usage.

  You can't stop or hibernate instance store-backed instances. You can't use the
  Stop action to hibernate Spot Instances, but you can specify that Amazon EC2
  should hibernate Spot Instances when they are interrupted. For more information,
  see [Hibernating interrupted Spot Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-interruptions.html#hibernate-spot-instances)
  in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

  When you stop or hibernate an instance, we shut it down. You can restart your
  instance at any time. Before stopping or hibernating an instance, make sure it
  is in a state from which it can be restarted. Stopping an instance does not
  preserve data stored in RAM, but hibernating an instance does preserve data
  stored in RAM. If an instance cannot hibernate successfully, a normal shutdown
  occurs.

  Stopping and hibernating an instance is different to rebooting or terminating
  it. For example, when you stop or hibernate an instance, the root device and any
  other devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance,
  the root device and any other devices attached during the instance launch are
  automatically deleted. For more information about the differences between
  rebooting, stopping, hibernating, and terminating instances, see [Instance lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html)
  in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide*.

  When you stop an instance, we attempt to shut it down forcibly after a short
  while. If your instance appears stuck in the stopping state after a period of
  time, there may be an issue with the underlying host computer. For more
  information, see [Troubleshoot stopping your instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesStopping.html)

  Shuts down the specified instances.

  This operation is idempotent; if you terminate an instance more than once, each
  call succeeds.

  If you specify multiple instances and the request fails (for example, because of
  a single incorrect instance ID), none of the instances are terminated.

  If you terminate multiple instances across multiple Availability Zones, and one
  or more of the specified instances are enabled for termination protection, the
  request fails with the following results:

    * The specified instances that are in the same Availability Zone as
  the protected instance are not terminated.

    * The specified instances that are in different Availability Zones,
  where no other specified instances are protected, are successfully terminated.

  For example, say you have the following instances:

    * Instance A: `us-east-1a`; Not protected

    * Instance B: `us-east-1a`; Not protected

    * Instance C: `us-east-1b`; Protected

    * Instance D: `us-east-1b`; not protected

  If you attempt to terminate all of these instances in the same request, the
  request reports failure with the following results:

    * Instance A and Instance B are successfully terminated because none
  of the specified instances in `us-east-1a` are enabled for termination
  protection.

    * Instance C and Instance D fail to terminate because at least one
  of the specified instances in `us-east-1b` (Instance C) is enabled for
  termination protection.

  Terminated instances remain visible after termination (for approximately one
  hour).

  By default, Amazon EC2 deletes all EBS volumes that were attached when the
  instance launched. Volumes attached after instance launch continue running.

  You can stop, start, and terminate EBS-backed instances. You can only terminate
  instance store-backed instances. What happens to an instance differs if you stop
  it or terminate it. For example, when you stop an instance, the root device and
  any other devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an
  instance, any attached EBS volumes with the `DeleteOnTermination` block device
  mapping parameter set to `true` are automatically deleted. For more information
  about the differences between stopping and terminating instances, see [Instance lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html)
