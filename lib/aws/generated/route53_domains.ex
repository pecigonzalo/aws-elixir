  automatically each year. We'll notify you in advance of the renewal date so you
  can choose whether to renew the registration.

  contact for the registrar or the phrase "REDACTED FOR PRIVACY", or "On behalf of

  return the information that you entered for the administrative, registrant, and

  When you transfer the registration, the previous registrar will not renew your
  domain registration and could end your DNS service at any time.
