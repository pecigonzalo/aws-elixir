  Amazon Relational Database Service

  Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it
  easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.

  It provides cost-efficient, resizeable capacity for an industry-standard
  relational database and manages common database administration tasks, freeing up
  developers to focus on what makes their applications and businesses unique.

  Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL,
  Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Db2, or Amazon Aurora database server. These
  capabilities mean that the code, applications, and tools you already use today
  with your existing databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon
  RDS automatically backs up your database and maintains the database software
  that powers your DB instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your DB
  instance's compute resources and storage capacity to meet your application's
  demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front investments, and
  you pay only for the resources you use.

  This interface reference for Amazon RDS contains documentation for a programming
  or command line interface you can use to manage Amazon RDS. Amazon RDS is
  asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques such as
  polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been applied. In
  this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a command is applied
  immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the maintenance window. The
  reference structure is as follows, and we list following some related topics
  from the user guide.

  First, EC2 or VPC security groups can be added to the DBSecurityGroup if the

  Web Services KMS) key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the
  DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region.

    * `TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` - The identifier for the new
  copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region.

    * `SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier` - The DB cluster snapshot
  identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier
  must be in the ARN format for the source Amazon Web Services Region and is the

  Creates a blue/green deployment.

  A blue/green deployment creates a staging environment that copies the production
  environment. In a blue/green deployment, the blue environment is the current
  production environment. The green environment is the staging environment. The
  staging environment stays in sync with the current production environment using
  logical replication.

  You can make changes to the databases in the green environment without affecting
  production workloads. For example, you can upgrade the major or minor DB engine
  version, change database parameters, or make schema changes in the staging
  environment. You can thoroughly test changes in the green environment. When
  ready, you can switch over the environments to promote the green environment to
  be the new production environment. The switchover typically takes under a

  Creates a new DB cluster parameter group.

  Parameters in a DB cluster parameter group apply to all of the instances in a DB

  A DB cluster parameter group is initially created with the default parameters

  values for any of the parameters, you must modify the group after creating it
  using `ModifyDBClusterParameterGroup`. Once you've created a DB cluster
  parameter group, you need to associate it with your DB cluster using
  `ModifyDBCluster`.

  Deletes a previously provisioned DB instance.

  When you delete a DB instance, all automated backups for that instance are
  deleted and can't be recovered. However, manual DB snapshots of the DB instance
  aren't deleted.

  If you request a final DB snapshot, the status of the Amazon RDS DB instance is
  `deleting` until the DB snapshot is created. This operation can't be canceled or
  reverted after it begins. To monitor the status of this operation, use
  `DescribeDBInstance`.

  When a DB instance is in a failure state and has a status of `failed`,
  `incompatible-restore`, or `incompatible-network`, you can only delete it when
  you skip creation of the final snapshot with the `SkipFinalSnapshot` parameter.

  If the specified DB instance is part of an Amazon Aurora DB cluster, you can't
  delete the DB instance if both of the following conditions are true:

    * The DB cluster is a read replica of another Amazon Aurora DB
  cluster.

    * The DB instance is the only instance in the DB cluster.

  To delete a DB instance in this case, first use the
  `PromoteReadReplicaDBCluster` operation to promote the DB cluster so that it's
  no longer a read replica. After the promotion completes, use the
  `DeleteDBInstance` operation to delete the final instance in the DB cluster.

  For RDS Custom DB instances, deleting the DB instance permanently deletes the
  EC2 instance and the associated EBS volumes. Make sure that you don't terminate
  or delete these resources before you delete the DB instance. Otherwise, deleting
  the DB instance and creation of the final snapshot might fail.

  Forces a failover for a DB cluster.

  For an Aurora DB cluster, failover for a DB cluster promotes one of the Aurora
  Replicas (read-only instances) in the DB cluster to be the primary DB instance
  (the cluster writer).

  For a Multi-AZ DB cluster, after RDS terminates the primary DB instance, the
  internal monitoring system detects that the primary DB instance is unhealthy and
  promotes a readable standby (read-only instances) in the DB cluster to be the
  primary DB instance (the cluster writer). Failover times are typically less than
  35 seconds.

  An Amazon Aurora DB cluster automatically fails over to an Aurora Replica, if
  one exists, when the primary DB instance fails. A Multi-AZ DB cluster
  automatically fails over to a readable standby DB instance when the primary DB
  instance fails.

  To simulate a failure of a primary instance for testing, you can force a
  failover. Because each instance in a DB cluster has its own endpoint address,
  make sure to clean up and re-establish any existing connections that use those
  endpoint addresses when the failover is complete.

  Promotes the specified secondary DB cluster to be the primary DB cluster in the
  global database cluster to fail over or switch over a global database.

  Switchover operations were previously called "managed planned failovers."

  Although this operation can be used either to fail over or to switch over a
  global database cluster, its intended use is for global database failover. To
  switch over a global database cluster, we recommend that you use the
  `SwitchoverGlobalCluster` operation instead.

  How you use this operation depends on whether you are failing over or switching
  over your global database cluster:

    * Failing over - Specify the `AllowDataLoss` parameter and don't
  specify the `Switchover` parameter.

    * Switching over - Specify the `Switchover` parameter or omit it,
  but don't specify the `AllowDataLoss` parameter.

  ## About failing over and switching over

  While failing over and switching over a global database cluster both change the
  primary DB cluster, you use these operations for different reasons:

    * *Failing over* - Use this operation to respond to an unplanned
  event, such as a Regional disaster in the primary Region. Failing over can
  result in a loss of write transaction data that wasn't replicated to the chosen
  secondary before the failover event occurred. However, the recovery process that
  promotes a DB instance on the chosen seconday DB cluster to be the primary
  writer DB instance guarantees that the data is in a transactionally consistent
  state.

  For more information about failing over an Amazon Aurora global database, see
  [Performing managed failovers for Aurora global databases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-global-database-disaster-recovery.html#aurora-global-database-failover.managed-unplanned)
  in the *Amazon Aurora User Guide*.

    * *Switching over* - Use this operation on a healthy global database
  cluster for planned events, such as Regional rotation or to fail back to the
  original primary DB cluster after a failover operation. With this operation,
  there is no data loss.

  For more information about switching over an Amazon Aurora global database, see
