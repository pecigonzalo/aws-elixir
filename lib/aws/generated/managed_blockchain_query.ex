  Amazon Managed Blockchain (AMB) Query provides you with convenient access to
  multi-blockchain network data, which makes it easier for you to extract
  contextual data related to blockchain activity.

  You can use AMB Query to read data from public blockchain networks, such as
  Bitcoin Mainnet and Ethereum Mainnet. You can also get information such as the
  current and historical balances of addresses, or you can get a list of
  blockchain transactions for a given time period. Additionally, you can get
  details of a given transaction, such as transaction events, which you can
  further analyze or use in business logic for your applications.
